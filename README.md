# Introduction to Linux Shell and Shell Scripting

Using any modern operating system like Linux, macOS, or Windows involves interacting with a shell, which interprets and executes user commands. In Linux, this interaction typically happens through the terminal, where users type commands for the shell to process.

Before learning shell scripting, you must understand:

* Kernel
* Shell
* Terminal

## Kernel
The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. It manages the following resources of the Linux system:

* File management
* Process management
* I/O management
* Memory management
* Device management etc.
Complete Linux system = Kernel + GNUsystem utilities and libraries + other management scripts + installation scripts.
